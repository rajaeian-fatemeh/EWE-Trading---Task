# Summary of analysis
LNG send-outs are influenced by a multitude of factors spanning supply, demand, market dynamics, infrastructure, regulations, and geopolitics. Demand for natural gas plays a pivotal role in driving LNG send-outs, with higher demand leading to increased volumes being exported or distributed to importing countries.

According to the plot, around early April, there is a significant dip followed by a rise in LNG send-outs. This dip followed by an increase suggests a temporary decrease in LNG send-outs, possibly due to factors such as changes in supply availability, operational issues, or fluctuations in demand. The subsequent rise indicates a recovery or increase in send-outs following the dip.

April is typically when the market enters the injection season. During the injection season, natural gas storage facilities are replenished to build up reserves for the upcoming winter demand. Utilities and gas traders may prioritize injecting natural gas into storage over LNG send-outs to ensure an adequate supply cushion. This increased demand for storage replenishment can reduce available capacity for LNG send-outs.

Furthermore, Germany experienced a temporary increase in temperature in early April 2024. This observable and temporary increase in temperature led to a corresponding decrease in demand for natural gas. However, consistent hot weather increases cooling demand but this temporary temperature rise did not increase electricity demand. This temporary rise in temperature may also have contributed to a reduction in LNG send-outs.

Subsequently, Germany experienced another decrease in temperature following the initial rise in early April 2024. It's plausible that this change could be attributed to increased gas usage for heating and other purposes. This resulted in a rise in LNG send-outs once again. Additionally, these weather fluctuations may impact storage injection strategies, as utilities and gas traders adjust their storage replenishment activities in response to changing demand patterns. This could also serve as another incentive for the increase in LNG send-outs observed after April 6th.The plot's trend after April 6th exhibits no significant deviations, with fluctuations appearing within expected ranges according to the context of the issue.
